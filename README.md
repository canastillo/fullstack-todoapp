# Fullstack ToDo App
Single Page Application using React as frontend and NestJS as backend.

## Requirements
- MySQL 8.0.24
- NodeJS 13.14.0
- npm 6.14.4
- NestJS 8.1.5
- React 17.0.2

## Features
- Adding, editing and deleting todos
- Adding, editing and deleting folders
- Set up and run app with bash script

## Usage
On a linux environment, run `bash script.sh`. You'll be asked to **enter your mysql root user password twice**: first time is for creating the database, and second one for storing it as an environment variable in order to allow NestJS to connect to the database.

## Personal challenges
- My first NestJS app
- Fisrt time using TypeORM
- My first bash script
